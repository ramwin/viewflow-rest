# viewflow-rest
provide restful viewflow 

many of code in the project looks like django-viewflow. I want to keep the interface as same as the [django viewflow](https://github.com/viewflow/viewflow).

Thanks you for all the [contributors of viewflow](https://github.com/viewflow/viewflow/graphs/contributors).
